# BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator web application. It allows users to enter their weight and height, and it calculates their BMI based on the input. The application then displays the corresponding BMI result, indicating whether the person is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

## Usage

1. Enter your weight in kilograms (KG) in the designated input field.
2. Enter your height in centimeters (CM) in the designated input field.
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to calculate your BMI.
4. The BMI result will be displayed below the button, indicating whether you are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

# BMI Categories
The calculated BMI will fall into one of the following categories:

    Underweight: BMI <= 18.4
    Normal: 18.5 <= BMI <= 24.9
    Overweight: 25 <= BMI <= 29.9
    Obese: BMI >= 30

# Example
Here's an example of how the BMI calculator works:

    Weight: 65 KG
    Height: 170 CM
    Calculating BMI:
    BMI = Weight (KG) / Height (M)^2
    BMI = 65 / (1.7)^2
    BMI â‰ˆ 22.49

    BMI falls into the "Normal" category.
